Deep AutoEncoder Network
========================

Introduction
------------
This is a C++11 implementation of deep autoencoder network,
which is introduced in 
  ```
  Hinton, G. E., & Salakhutdinov, R. R. (2006). 
  Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks. 
  Science, 313(5786), 504-507.
  ```

In order to illustrate the model itself clearly, 
further optimizations are omitted.

Demos
-----

  `$ make deep_ae_test_binary.o`

  `$ make deep_ae_test_continuous.o`

  Compile tests passed on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, g++ 4.8.4.

Further Developments
--------------------

The experiments mentioned in the paper will be performed using this library.
